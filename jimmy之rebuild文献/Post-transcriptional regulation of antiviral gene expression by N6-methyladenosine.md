## term
| term      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| beta matrix      | One single beta matrix to do filtering. (default = myImport$beta)       |
| M matrix   | One single M matrix to do filtering. (default = NULL).         |
| intensity matrix     | intensity matrix. (default = NULL).       |
| Meth          | Methylated matrix. (default = NULL).        |
| UnMeth     | UnMethylated matrix. (default = NULL).       |
| detP    | Detected P value matrix for corresponding beta matrix, it MUST be 100% corresponding, which can be ignored if you don't have.(default = NULL)        |
| beadcount      | Beadcount information for Green and Red Channal, need for filterBeads.(default = NULL)       |
| pd   | pd file related to this beta matrix, suggest provided, because maybe filtering would be on pd file. (default = myImport$pd)        |
